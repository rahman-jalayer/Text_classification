A government-commissioned analysis by Pricewaterhouse Coopers has estimated that the new measures will spur a building boom expected to add between 48,200 and 105,500 new units of housing in New Zealand by the end of the decade. The Conservatives proposed tying federal transit funding to a city’s willingness to densify, but there were no blunt New Zealand-style promises to override onerous local zoning laws “If there was a blanket up-zoning of land in Canadian metropolitan areas, it would lead to an increase in the housing stock,” said Steve Lafleur, an analyst specializing in housing affordability at the Fraser Institute."

54,Which of the competing housing bills will make the cut?,https://www.housingwire.com/articles/which-of-the-competing-housing-bills-will-make-the-cut/,HousingWire,"The real question is, given the reality that the Build Back Better and budget bills in play are likely to end up far smaller than the original ask from President Biden, where will these housing bills end up, and will any of them make it off the cutting room floor into final legislation? While some of the same groups object to this bill, as it does not address the down payment road block that many prospective minority homebuyers face, advocates argue that this bill, combined with the Waters/Warnock DPA bill, could solve both the down payment and equity creation objectives together. The good news is that, should this legislation not move forward at this juncture, there are scaleable solutions to provide DPA for FTHBs via a plethora of providers from state Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs), other housing agencies, and governmental entities that are available in every state in the nation."
55,Grape Farming in Washington,https://www.historylink.org/File/21302,HistoryLink.org,"In the decade from 2008 to 2018, the average production was about 185,000 tons annually, and in a typical year, industry leader Welch's might process 100,000 to 120,000 tons of Washington juice grapes, resulting in 20 to 22 million gallons of juice, all stored in Grandview ""at the largest juice tank farm in all of North America"" (""Concord Costs …""). Concords were first planted in the Yakima Valley in 1904. The Kennewick Courier reported that the verdict of the judge, an apple farmer from Idaho, ""aroused widespread indignation and protests are pouring in, not only from the parties concerned in the injustice of it but from hundreds of others who are disinterested persons but who appreciate the fine points of grapes and are capable of making a just comparison of displays, qualities and varieties."
56,How Much Does Attic Insulation Cost?,https://www.bobvila.com/articles/attic-insulation-cost/,Bob Vila,": $1,500 to $3,500 National Average: $2,500 If the attic has little or no insulation or the existing insulation is damaged and must be removed, the installer will have to add significantly more new insulation, which will result in a higher cost. Insulating your attic yourself rather than hiring a pro will save on labor to the tune of between $0.25 to $2.50 per square foot, but you’ll also need to know how to block out the attic’s intake vents to keep from covering them up, as this can lead to roof damage."
57,30 years and still standing: The University of Sydney’s Stucco Housing Cooperative,http://honisoit.com/2021/10/30-years-and-still-standing-the-university-of-sydneys-stucco-housing-cooperative/,Honi Soit,"On the top floor of the University of Sydney’s Manning Bar, a bunch of architecture students meet every second Monday as the ‘Sydney University Housing Co-operative’, later to be known as ‘Stucco.’ They are drawing up the plans for a new, alternative type of affordable housing. Stucco stands just off Newtown’s King Street, a 15-minute walk from campus and is centrally concerned with providing equitable housing for low-income students. More than just a roundtable for progressive politics, Edie says Stucco was radically different to all the “exploitative natures embedded in every other part of the social fabric.” She says, Stucco was “the first time I really found a queer community that I could really be a part of.” There is this sort of understanding, maybe fundamentally by its alternative decision-making, that Stucco can be understood in every facet as a sort of counter-culture."
58,The real estate market & student loans: Hot topics in a changing landscape,https://www.ama-assn.org/residents-students/resident-student-finance/real-estate-market-student-loans-hot-topics-changing,American Medical Association,"I am very excited today to talk with Eileen from Laurel Road about the relationship with Laurel Road and the AMA, specifically, because this was something that I personally went through in the past year, as I moved from my medical school location, which was down in the south, back up to the Midwest and really had to look into some of these big things that honestly, over the last couple of years, I have not spent a whole bunch of time thinking about. Today, I'm leading out the build-out and growth of the mortgage business for Laurel Road and I'm responsible for establishing the strategic direction, the growth plan, the digital roadmap for our product, which offers a personalized simplified process for anyone looking to finance or refinance a mortgage and the benefits associated with doing so through a digital platform—and through the AMA, which includes flexible terms, low interest rates and a really digital application process that makes it easy and streamlined for AMA members to finance or refinance. And so if you're going to be in a home for less than four years, then it'll be harder to recoup those costs if you're going to be in that home for or years greater than that allows you to really, to take advantage of the benefits of home ownership, where you can potentially write off your interest rate, start building equity and equity is a great thing because you can always borrow against that, should you ever need to fund any expenses for the home."
59,What’s so funny about my Southern accent?,https://reckonsouth.com/whats-so-funny-about-my-southern-accent/,Reckon South,"“Especially at times when people need to speak up in professional settings,” he said, “If they are not carrying the confidence they deserve, if they are critiquing themselves before they even open their mouths, they are not going to perform as well as they could.” Let me repeat that for those of you in the back: If Southerners are never heard saying intelligent things, the Southern accent will never be associated with intelligence. You see, when we lose our accents, we lose one of the best parts of our Southern heritage."

In addition, the poll said about three-quarters of Canadians have noticed so-called shrinkflation, the reduction in the amount of food in a package to adjust for inflation without raising prices."

Driscoll boasts a slew of endorsements including from the Pinellas Realtors Organization, the Sierra Club, the National Organization of Woman, the Sun Coast Police Benevolent Association, U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, state Sen. Darryl Rouson, and from fellow council members from across the political spectrum — Darden Rice, Brandi Gabbard, Robert Blackmon and Ed Montanari."

At that point, the company should have sufficient evidence to apply for an extension of the L-1A visas, which will allow the foreign national executives and managers to extend their stay in the United States and ensure that the organization and operations of the U.S. company align with the Singaporean company’s business model."

According to the latest forecast by Lawrence Yun of the Washington, DC-based NAR, with buyer demand easing and housing starts improving to 1.65 million units in 2022 (compared to an estimated 1.565 million units this year), existing-home sales prices should increase at a far slower pace next year – 4.4% compared this year’s 14.1%.

While raising flood insurance premiums is a step in the right direction, a study by the First Street Foundation earlier this year calculated that even after adopting Risk Rating 2.0, the NFIP would have to increase its rates by 4.5 times to cover the estimated flooding risk of the properties it insures in 2021. In other words, the federal government is still subsidizing people to build, live, and work in areas where the warming climate increases the risks of inland flooding, sea level rise and hurricane damage."

As a result, investors are now flooding into the market again, after falling back a bit during the first year of the Covid pandemic. Nationally, rents rose 9.3% in August, year over year, up from a 2.2% year-over-year increase in August 2020, according to CoreLogic."
79,US: Getting back on track,https://think.ing.com/articles/us-getting-back-on-track/,ING Think,"For electoral reasons, Republicans want to label the Democrats as the party of higher spending, taxes and debt and have made it clear they will not be making it an easy process. The Republicans have offered an extension of the debt ceiling until December, but this will merely kick the proverbial can down the road and we will be facing the same dilemma in two months' time. With little chance of getting the 60 Senate votes required to raise the ceiling, we expect the Democrats will have to go it alone and use the more complicated budget reconciliations process to suspend the debt ceiling."
80,"Toronto home sales and prices up, but new listings down in September: TRREB - Toronto",https://globalnews.ca/news/8243727/toronto-real-estate-board-listings-sales-september/,Nasdaq | Flipboard,"Toronto Regional Real Estate Board says the market kicked off the fall selling season with an 18 per cent increase in homes sold in September and a 34 per cent drop in new listings. The uptick in sales is typical when autumn arrives, but the board said this year’s spike was the third-highest on record for September and signals that the market is still facing tightened conditions. The board predicted in February that by the year’s end, the average selling price in the region will have reached $1.025 million, up from an average $929,692 last year."
81,Trevor Story’s Likely Final Home Game At Coors Field Ends With Rockies’ Victory,https://recentlyheard.com/2021/09/30/trevor-storys-likely-final-home-game-at-coors-field-ends-with-rockies-victory/,RecentlyHeard,"One of my favorite places to eat in the Twin Cities, Estelle’s menu changes with the seasons, but always includes plenty of options for those who don’t eat meat. There’s a whole section of the menu dedicated to vegetables, including real, hand-parched wild rice, which is a treat all on its own; sweet potatoes drizzled in a delicious chili crisp; and cornbread that is kissed with a campfire flavor because it’s cooked in a corn husk. Starting with a rich, sweet borscht, the Georgian cheese bread that is like American garlic bread but better, and moving to Vareniki, dumplings stuffed with mashed potatoes and caramelized onions and some of the best potato pancakes (called Deruny) I’ve ever tasted, you can make a meal before ever getting to the single vegetarian entree, which is a stir-fryish dish called Givtech that is loaded with summer squash, cauliflower, sweet peppers and mushrooms, all cooked perfectly, kissed with dill and served over rice pilaf, or my preference, a hearty buckwheat."
82,Carter: Another Charter School Plus – High Voter Turnout,https://recentlyheard.com/2021/10/13/carter-another-charter-school-plus-high-voter-turnout/,RecentlyHeard,"Most of the Astros’ hitters walked free in the sign-stealing scandal that shook the sport before the 2020 season, but it was Cora and Carlos Beltran who were painted as the masterminds, with both losing their jobs as big league managers following MLB’s report. He did it in ’18, and then this year (his home run in) that last game of the regular season set the tone for the team to keep going and keep pushing.” “When I went to bunt with two outs and I popped out (in Tampa), the next inning Iggy sat down with me and said, ‘Hey, when you bunt, you move your back foot a lot,’” Arroyo said."
83,Galveston’s Latest Storm Has No Season,https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/galveston-short-term-rental-housing/,Texas Monthly,"Since 2010, Vision Galveston estimates that Galveston, which is home to about 50,000 residents, has lost nearly eight hundred families with children, a 16 percent decrease in local families, though many of the adults continue to commute to the city each day for work from towns within a half-hour drive, such as La Marque, Dickinson, and League City. The organization has found that the island is being drained of children, particularly those who are Black and Hispanic—meaning that home-owning families have been leaving the island at the same time that the number of renters is increasing. “I’ve seen countless teachers who are not from this area move here for a job and like working here, but will tell you they left for the mainland because they can spend half as much and get a backyard in a subdivision without the high cost of insurance,” he says."
84,I want to make sure my son always has a place to live. Should I add him to the deed for my house?,https://newsakmi.com/news/finance/stock-market/i-want-to-make-sure-my-son-always-has-a-place-to-live-should-i-add-him-to-the-deed-for-my-house/,News AKMI,"According to Texas-based lawyer Rania Combs, instead of being a legally-binding document, a letter of intent “provides valuable information about your child’s life to help guardians, trustees and courts understand your hopes and desires for him or her.” What if, for some reason, your son could no longer live in a home you left for him — what should his guardian ensure he has in terms of shelter? Programs such as Medicaid are means-tested, so you will need to ensure that whatever assets you leave behind to him do not end up complicating his care by disqualifying him from that assistance or reducing the amount of help he’s eligible for. The problem arises if he were to leave the home for some reason — for instance, if his health worsens to the point where it is determined that he would be better served by moving to an assisted-living facility or a nursing home."

Article content The Panama Papers, derived from a trove of documents leaked from the Panamanian offshore corporate services firm Mossack Fonseca, were followed up the following year by the Paradise Papers, based on leaked documents that included a paper trail showing how the Apple Corporation had transferred $128 billion to the British tax-haven island of Jersey, in the English Channel. Article content There's a fine line of a difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion In the revelations from this week’s Pandora Papers, legal hairsplitting is the only recourse available to Jordan’s King Abdullah II."
86,"When China slows, the world economy will stutter",https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/577379-when-china-slows-the-world-economy-will-stutter,TheHill,"It should also be alerting us to the strong likelihood that the world will no longer be able to rely on China, the world’s second-largest economy, to be its main engine of economic growth and to be the main driver of the international commodity market. The real significance of the Evergrande debacle is that it should be a reminder to us of the unsustainability of China’s present economic model, which has relied on an outsized housing and credit market bubble to keep the country on a high economic growth path. If the Chinese economy were to slow in the same way that Japan’s economy slowed in the two decades following its economic miracle and property bubble in the 1960s and 1970s, it will have a profound long-run impact on the world economy."

The official Xinhua News Agency reported that over the seven-day holiday beginning Oct. 1, China saw 515 million trips taken, just over 70% during the same period last year before the coronavirus outbreak spurred travel restrictions and demands for testing, vaccinations and quarantines."

For instance, if your homeowner’s insurance covers $300,000 in personal liability insurance but your umbrella policy does not kick in until $500,000, you will be responsible for the $200,000 in between. The reality is that civil suits can, and often do, result in judgments or settlements that run into the millions of dollars, and judges and juries have no obligation to limit awarded damages to an amount the party being sued can comfortably afford."

What I especially like about Riverside Common is that it fronts onto Queen Street East, making it a public space truly open to all of the community, not just those who live in the buildings surrounding it. Whether a public space has an urban or a natural design, is just recently built as part of an ongoing development or has been around for more than a century, these are what make a city like ours liveable and help build a strong sense of community."
98,Kiszla vs. O’Halloran: Could Broncos quarterback Drew Lock get in game at Cleveland?,https://recentlyheard.com/2021/10/18/kiszla-vs-ohalloran-could-broncos-quarterback-drew-lock-get-in-game-at-cleveland/,RecentlyHeard,"On a painfully short week of preparation, they either will find a way to win Thursday in Cleveland or be dismissed as the same sorry team that has missed the NFL playoffs for five years running. If the Broncos fall behind the Browns, yes, I would give Lock a chance if only to tell him, “Throw it long … a lot,” but I put the actual chances at Fangio making the switch at, oh, 4%. But here’s why I’d be tempted to give Lock a shot: Is this offense built to score 30 points with Bridgewater running the show?"
99,"Study finds Airbnb units expand market but reduce long-term rentals, including affordable housing",https://yubanet.com/life/study-finds-airbnb-units-expand-market-but-reduce-long-term-rentals-including-affordable-housing/,YubaNet,"The study found that the presence of Airbnb units in a community caused a mild decrease in the long-term rental supply (i.e., switchers), including affordable housing, which harmed local renters. “The benefits of renting for the landlords can be directly observed from the prices and occupancy rates in the long-term market and on Airbnb,” notes Kannan Srinivasan, Professor of Management, Marketing, and Information Systems at CMU’s Tepper School of Business, who coauthored the study. They used data from two sources to construct a comprehensive list of potentially available properties in selected areas: 1) every property listed on Airbnb in nine representative metropolitan areas in 2015 and 2017, collected by AirDNA, a third-party company specializing in data collection and analysis, and 2) the 2015 and 2017 American Housing Survey, a comprehensive, longitudinal, national housing survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau."
100,Canada’s housing market unlikely to cool as new home buyers opt for variable loans - National,https://globalnews.ca/news/8265811/canada-home-buyers-loans-rising-fixed-rates/,Global News,"A recent move by major Canadian banks to increase fixed mortgage rates on the back of surging bond yields is unlikely to slow the country’s red hot housing market, as more than half of new borrowers take out variable-rate loans that are the cheapest they’ve ever been. The market share of new variable-rate mortgages surged to 51 per cent in July, the highest level since the Bank of Canada began tracking the data in 2013, from less than 10 per cent in early 2020, and mortgage brokers say this has continued to increase since then. Canada’s biggest banks have raised their five-year fixed rates in response to the surge in bond yields — ranging from Royal Bank of Canada’s rate of 2.44 per cent to Toronto-Dominion Bank’s 2.29 per cent."

It’s true that the higher your credit score, the more likely you are to be approved for a mortgage with a low interest rate.

The push to resettle the first wave of Afghan evacuees brought to the U.S. is expected to take months longer than first anticipated as a measles scare, a nationwide housing shortage and paperwork delays have slowed the process, according to government and resettlement officials familiar with the effort.

I wanted to send this woman a thank-you note (I have her email, thanks to mom), but I thought that would be intrusive, so I'm writing to you instead in the hope that she reads you: Thank you for being an ethical person and getting my brother to do what I never could — save for his future — and I'm sorry about that crazed email from our mom."

In a time of crisis, like after two years of pandemic learning loss, we are apt to spend immense resources inefficiently unless we acknowledge that facts and memory are worthy goals and that direct instruction has a role to play. If we want to make post-pandemic schools better for students, we must ground our teaching in the science that reveals the importance of knowledge and memory, the need to meet students where they are, and the outsize role that belonging plays in students’ educational lives."

Regrading the site directly around your home to slope away from the foundation prevents the pooling of runoff and can help direct water around your home to a lower portion of the site where it’s no longer a threat to the basement. By keeping storm water, snowmelt, and runoff away from your home, you decrease the risk level of the basement renovation, which can help reduce the cost and complexity of the remodeling work."

Hayek, ""The Collective Works of F.A. One way to think of the U.S. treasury market’s ability to maintain buyers and holders despite real interest rates, at least at negative 1% (depending on your gauge of inflation), is that this market has become a weigh station, a storage space for dollar-denominated assets, intended to balance existing portfolios of dollar-denominated equity, real estate and corporate debt holdings, as a reserve account that incentivizes participants to remain within the bounds of the existing USD ecosystem. This is the battle of the 21st century, and it is of the utmost importance."

The pace of construction in Berlin has picked up in recent years, with 19,000 completed apartments in 2019, but still not by enough.

Though the show is ostensibly about finding a fictionalized version of “love”, it seems like the real driving force here is to make it on the show long enough to get into the fantasy suite, so that Michelle can take a sneaky-pee ky at what’s happening in these men’s trousers. Regardless, these are the men who our lovely Michelle Young will be forced to try to love, and I’m sorry, her options seem to be pretty mediocre—as if the producers gathered the dregs of the dating pool from Bumble, Hinge, Tinder, Raya, and perhaps Match.com, dressed them all in their best Express for Men blouses, and unleashed them upon an unwitting public."

And as the plan makes short-term rentals a “top priority,” Heil said that town staff is planning to gather more information about short-term rentals in the town — as well as what other mountain communities are doing — and provide a report to council in January."

In a media release, the association said there are 360 homes per 1,000 residents in the GTA (greater Toronto area) — lower than the Canadian and G7 average, and recent studies have shows that 79,000 more homes per year need to be built between 2021 and 2031 in the GTA alone to keep up with demand."

What seems to be happening instead is that the pandemic led many U.S. workers to rethink their lives and ask whether it was worth staying in the lousy jobs too many of them had. Not everyone can afford to quit a hated job, but a significant number of workers seem ready to accept the risk of trying something different — retiring earlier despite the monetary cost, looking for a less unpleasant job in a different industry, and so on."

It comes as AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver estimated Sydney house prices were as much as 39 per cent overvalued, on one measure, and units about 30 per cent, and forecast prices would keep rising next year but at a slower pace. Elsewhere, NAB slightly revised up its dwelling price growth forecasts to 23 per cent during 2021 and a further 5 per cent in 2022 across the capital cities, from its previous expectations of 19 per cent this year and 4 per cent next year."

As has been said so often, St Paul is a DFL town, and once someone is placed on or voted into one of the aforementioned groups, it’s basically a race to get around existing law, or changing the law, to fit progressive DFL politics. After reading “At least 4 of 7 St Paul City Council members to vote ‘no’ on rent control; mayor tight-lipped” on TwinCities.com, I’m incredibly disappointed that four council members support the deceptive disinformation of corporate landlord lobby groups who seek to maintain their unchecked power over renters in St. Paul while gouging these same tenants with unaffordable spikes in rent."

Lifshitz also pointed out that the antibodies produced by the vaccine are in your blood, not in the places where you're exposed to the virus.

For property investors who need some cash or want to roll money into a better investment, it appears to be the perfect time to sell a Long Island property. Although you can sell your properties at any time, it’s better to do it when the demand is high and people are willing to pay a premium."

260,Black Philadelphians less likely to be approved for mortgages than their white neighbors,https://6abc.com/data-investigation-housing-inequity-home-loan-mortgage/11090827/,6ABC,"But after talking to family and friends, Gardner realized she was not alone.Black residents of the Philadelphia area are less likely to get approved for a mortgage than white residents, according to a 6abc data analysis of every 2018 and 2019 mortgage application, which are reported to the federal government under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA).In the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington metro area, white applicants' loans are approved at higher rates than Black applicants' at almost every income level and every loan amount range, the 6abc analysis found. ""I had to sign my whole life away,"" Gardner said.When a Black applicant's loan is denied in Philadelphia, it is more likely to be due to credit history, employment history, insufficient cash for down payment and closing costs, debt-to-income ratio, or unverifiable information, than when a white applicant's loan is denied, according to the 6abc analysis.High debt-to-income ratios, low credit scores, and inability to afford down payments are common among Black prospective homebuyers, according to Lydia Pope, President-Elect of the National Association of Real Estate Brokers (NAREB), a minority trade association that promotes democracy in housing. These partners include lenders, City programs and other organizations.But even if applicants have a good credit score and can afford a down payment and closing costs, they still may end up with an inferior mortgage that will wind up costing them more money and hurting the chances of their offer being accepted by a seller.When Lydia Pope's niece got a home loan, she had a high enough credit score for a conventionally approved mortgage, as well as a low debt-to-income ratio and enough money for a down payment."

There’s a whole section of the menu dedicated to vegetables, including real, hand-parched wild rice, which is a treat all on its own; sweet potatoes drizzled in a delicious chili crisp; and cornbread that is kissed with a campfire flavor because it’s cooked in a corn husk. Starting with a rich, sweet borscht, the Georgian cheese bread that is like American garlic bread but better, and moving to Vareniki, dumplings stuffed with mashed potatoes and caramelized onions and some of the best potato pancakes (called Deruny) I’ve ever tasted, you can make a meal before ever getting to the single vegetarian entree, which is a stir-fryish dish called Givtech that is loaded with summer squash, cauliflower, sweet peppers and mushrooms, all cooked perfectly, kissed with dill and served over rice pilaf, or my preference, a hearty buckwheat."

A Senate committee in June held a hearing on a bill to similarly require the department to conduct clinical trials into the therapeutic potential of marijuana for military veterans with PTSD and chronic pain—but a VA representative said that the Biden administration is opposed to the reform. In 2018, the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee was the first congressional panel to approve a marijuana reform bill by passing an earlier version of legislation to encourage VA to conduct research on the medical benefits of cannabis."

That’s because the 4.5% yield figure Kiwi Property has given for its Sylvia Park apartments does not include any allowance for the value of the land on which they are being built, it is based purely on the build cost. However, given that there is currently a legion of vested interests promoting the idea of some sort of Government support for build-to-rent schemes and this Government’s enthusiasm for pouring money into housing schemes that produce relatively modest results, we could well see the “settings” that Mackenzie refers to being introduced."

756,I’m So Tempted to Dip Into the Money My Kids Inherited From Their Grandma,https://slate.com/business/2021/10/children-inheritance-grandma-bigger-jealous-money-advice.html,Slate,"All of which is to say, it’s probably not about whether your MIL thought your kids were smart enough to get through college on scholarships, or thought you’d waste the money, but whether she thought she was ensuring that your kids’ generation could start their adult lives from a place of financial stability—and she viewed that as something you simply didn’t need at this stage in your life. I think this is part of a larger conversation you need to have with your partner about what your mutual expectations are for sharing assets, and the solution that works best for you will be particular to the way you choose to conduct the marriage. So maybe the way to look at this is to think about what you would expect if the shoe were on the other foot, and your partner came to the relationship with more savings than you for exactly the same reasons."

Last August, CNBC reported that twice as many men as women invest in cryptocurrency of some form, positing that democratization of trading should be a focus of that particular market. Either way, Kapusta views the dearth of active women investors as a learning opportunity: “There’s often this self-doubt that comes into play… the opportunity for us is to continue to normalize the money conversation.” In the coming 12 months, it seems likely that “the money conversation” will extend to involve guidance for a sharply growing number of women looking to invest in all types of vehicles (which obviously includes real estate)."

And while his close friend and trainer Alex Guerrero maintains that gaining further vindication isn’t part of Brady’s motivation, it’s still hard to believe that proving he was dumped too soon by the Patriots doesn’t factor into the equation, as Harrison suggested. He also alluded to a revenge game of sorts for Brady with Sunday night’s showdown against his former team on tap."

Millard-Ball is hot off an article titled The Width and Value of Residential Streets published in the Journal of the American Planning Association. The article is an economic analysis of the value of streets and their opportunity cost which, he argues, informs the question of how wide a street should be."

According to a study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, a median-income household would now need to spend more than 32% of its annual income to afford a median-priced home which slightly eclipses the 30% affordability benchmark used by the U.S. government. For nonwhite Americans, the racial wealth gap already played a role in limiting their participation in the market but it is at risk of becoming more acute in the event they lose their home or prices continue to grow unabated."

This raised concerns that the troubled property giant could officially go into default following the expiry of a 30-day grace period to make the payment of a dollar bond coupon over the weekend.

To explain that, banks borrow short-term and lend long-term, hence should the Fed keep its interest rates steady in the next couple quarters and the 10-year Treasury note accelerates on the back of inflation and future rate hikes, financial stocks could enjoy another boost. Perhaps companies with strong exposure to Chinese markets, including semiconductors and tech firms, will be closely watched during the earnings season amid fears of fading sales in the region, though as regards the US housing market, it will probably avoid a China-style damage, but a slowdown could still be inevitable after an upbeat performance during the previous quarters."

The real estate industry has been largely let off the hook in the topsy-turvy world of rising house prices, ostensibly shielded by terms such as “supply and demand” and “market forces.” I suggest researchers take a closer look at the industry and its complicity in the relentless rise of house prices."

If the taxpayer sold the three properties on account of income, then he would not be able to rely on the principal residence exemption and would, therefore, need to include the income in his tax returns for the three taxation years in question. Under subsection 191(5) of the Excise Tax Act, a builder can forego remitting GST/HST on the sale of his or her property if the builder lives in the house that he/she has constructed or renovated as a personal residence, and if the builder did not claim any input tax credit in relation to the improvement or renovation of the property."

Pernicious inflation could complicate that plan, forcing them to raise rates earlier and more quickly than they would prefer to keep prices under control. Factory shutdowns, clogged shipping routes and labor shortages at ports and along trucking lines have combined to make goods difficult to produce and transport."

I guess the idea is that it is obvious that supply is the key to affordability, but it rather negates the idea of holding an inquiry, and it sits oddly with the explosion in prices we have seen in a year in which building approvals have surged by a near-record 224,000 and our population has as good as stayed still.

If you determine that the noise is coming from the street and entering the room through a window, the most effective solution is to install a double-pane window, which can achieve somewhat greater sound damping than single-pane windows due to the double glazing and frames, that are also filled with a sound-reducing material. This layer is composed of 3 fundamental elements: the insulating material, which can be either wool, PET, or mineral; the structure of the panel, which can be drywall attached to the wall or even a wooden structure; and the external finishing, that can be done in many different ways such as painting, woodwork, etc."

However, a coalition that includes the group Transparency International Canada told Cullen that lawyers, bankers and accountants should be included in any policies in order to allow for public scrutiny of how the advice of those professionals could be sought by criminal enterprises involved in money laundering."

No amount of forest thinning can stop that.Last year, more than 200 climate and forest scientists sent a letter to Congress urging lawmakers to transition away from mechanical forest management because it has only limited benefits and, under certain conditions, can make wildfires worse by littering the forest with wood debris and eliminating natural wind breaks.Given the obvious effect of human behavior on wildfire risk, and the relatively low cost of modifying homes or limiting development in fire-prone areas, why are policy makers directing nearly all of their spending toward costly expansions of firefighting capability and forest management projects that can slow or reduce the severity of some wildfires but are less effective at protecting homes?“There’s naivete about ecology and it’s good for local industry,” Richard Hutto , emeritus professor of forest ecology at the University of Montana, told me. The bills, dubbed “housing killers” by California home builders, were opposed by local governments, timber companies, realtors and the construction industry.Chris Ochoa, legislative counsel for the California Building Industry Association, said new limits on rural or exurban development fail to account for the merciless forces of California’s housing market, which has long been thrown out of balance by development limits in high-priced cities — limits often advocated by the same environmentalists who now demand an end to building in fire-prone areas.“If you look at maps of natural disasters, wildfires or earthquakes, floods, there are few areas in California that are immune from disaster,” Ochoa said in an interview."

The idea isn’t that Quebec would forcibly censor access to Facebook and Twitter (that’s more of a Trudeau government thing), but that the province would simply encourage young people to avoid “the loneliness and hatred” of the internet for a week. When Canadians were asked if they were proud of “Canada’s treatment of all groups in society,” 64 per cent of people in a visible minority said “yes.” This was against only 44 per cent who said “yes” among Canadians “not in a visible minority” (read: white people)."

1035,‘List It and Buyers Will Come’: Muskoka Sales Cool But Fall Demand Remains Strong,https://storeys.com/muskoka-real-estate-sales-september-crea-2021/,Toronto Storeys,"On a year-to-date basis, waterfront sales totalled 2,002 units over the first nine months of the year, falling modestly by 2.5% from the same period in 2020, according to the national real estate association. However, while last months’ year-over-year decline in sales is notable, Ross Halloran of Halloran & Associates, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada, says that when comparing September 2020 to 2021, the trends in Muskoka are directly linked to historically low inventory levels of waterfront properties over the past three years. Meanwhile, in September, the median price for waterfront property sales was $893,000, up 23.6% year-over-year, while the total year-to-date median price for this property category was $872,000, climbing 36% from the first nine months of 2020."

Jackson landed her first story as a paid journalist after “a rant about the ways in which people of color are excluded from study abroad programs and how the white solution is to mistake color for economic status and throw money at the problem.” She was at a brunch where she met the co-founders of the online Seattle Globalist. In “The Hood,” the article “Brad and Becky Are Coming to Rainier Beach” (South Seattle Emerald, December 27, 2017), Jackson gives us a story not often heard in the media: the perspective of a single Black female homeowner in Seattle coexisting with gentrification."
1037,Housing Market Moderation Gives Buyers Breathing Room,https://stockhouse.com/news/press-releases/2021/10/19/housing-market-moderation-gives-buyers-breathing-room,Stockhouse,"The Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) for the U.S. rose to $308,220 in September, up 1.6% from August. Homes are taking one day longer to sell than in August, with listings going into the pending stage in a median of just nine days, giving buyers a bit more time to find the homes they're looking for and make an offer on them before they're snatched up. Much like home appreciation, monthly rent growth in the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) slowed to 1.3%, down from recent highs of 2% in July and 1.5% in August."

Benefitting from relaxed financing conditions, Moscow and Stockholm have recorded the highest price growth rates among all analyzed cities over the last four quarters, and the market imbalances have increased sharply.

Comparing the U.S. and Canada in the COVID-19 pandemic The very old, those living in long-term care, and those with underlying health issues comprised the bulk of COVID-19 deaths in both countries during the early waves of the virus. Indeed, the gap between minority and majority populations with underlying health issues has greatly widened since the Great Recession in the U.S. and life expectancy in the U.S. has dropped – this is not the case in Canada (Chodosh, 2018; Statistics Canada, 2019) The COVID-19 crisis seems not different from the fallout of the Great Recession but is another tremor of deepening inequality that has dire consequences, many still unfolding, for the reproduction of societal structures and labour, and for generational relationships."

1084,How an Adoption Broker Cashed In on Prospective Parents’ Dreams,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/10/25/how-an-adoption-broker-cashed-in-on-prospective-parents-dreams,The New Yorker,"Lee encouraged Kyle and Adam to send their book to Angel, and they were thrilled when Lee told them that Angel had chosen them as adoptive parents. Everyone was gathered around the dining table when he handed Max to his mother and asked her to take his sweatshirt off, revealing a T-shirt that said “I’m going to be a big brother.” In a video that Kyle’s sister took on her iPhone, Kyle can be seen wiping tears from his eyes. According to Melanie Peterson, a mother of five in Milwaukee who tried to adopt through Always Hope, Lee told an improbable-sounding story of meeting the mother of her adopted children at a picnic one day; two weeks later, Lee claimed, the woman showed up at her door and announced that she wanted Lee to adopt from her."

1090,Not so fast on eliminating the property tax in Texas,https://www.bloghouston.com/2021/10/texas-property-tax/,blogHOUSTON,"Property and home owners will never really be secure in owning the property, because local governments in Texas will always have a gun at their disposal and everyone’s property will be encumbered with a tax imposed on the property that has to be paid to the government on an annual basis. I will say here that if the only consideration with regards to eliminating the property tax were ideological, that the concept that Texans aren’t secure in their property due to the property tax, I would not necessarily be opposed to getting rid of the property tax and replacing it with some kind of tax on commerce – whether a VAT or a sales tax. The population in Texas has grown by 9 million over the past 20 years – roughly 18% of all of America’s population growth over the past 20 years."

Rep. Maxine Waters, chair of the House Committee on Financial Services that is recommending the large outlay be included in the package, says that the challenges some voucher holders face isn’t reason enough to not give more people the opportunity to try, which is why she’ll push for housing to be a priority in the budget bill."

If it is not removed by the owner, the agency the officer represents will have the vehicle towed to a storage yard and the owner will be responsible for covering the cost along with any fines. Like Indiana and Kentucky, regardless of the situation, if the law enforcement agency has to have it removed, the owner of the vehicle is responsible for any and all towing and storage costs."

The basic premise is that one of the best ways we may contribute to stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions is to not build at all, or build very little, in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint by minimizing the energy and exhaustion of resources required to build anew. And we will have to answer not only whether we met our 2030 challenge, but whether our communities persevered through our efforts in resilient design and whether our efforts were bold enough to address climate change."

Those issues affected hundreds of accounts, with customers incurring trading losses on April 20, 2020 that exceeded $82.57 million, according to the CFTC. Last year, in a separate case, Interactive Brokers agreed to pay a total of $38 million in penalties to three federal agencies — including $11.5 million to the CFTC — to settle charges that it did not report suspicious trading activity and failed in its anti-money-laundering oversight for several years."
